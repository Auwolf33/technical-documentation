            <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style.
                There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style.
                In this article and its sub-articles we'll run through the different types in great detail, seeing how they work.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="what_is_a_selector">
            <header>What is a Selector?</header>
            <p>You have met selectors already. A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule.
                It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
                The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the <em>subject of the selector.</em></p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>h1 { <br>
                    color: blue; <br>
                    background-color: yellow; <br>
                    } <br> <br>
                    p { <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>In earlier articles you met some different selectors, and learned that there are selectors that target the document in different ways â€” for example by selecting an element such as <code>h1</code>, or a class such as <code>.special</code>.</p>
            <p>In CSS, selectors are defined in the CSS Selectors specification; like any other part of CSS they need to have support in browsers for them to work. The majority of selectors that you will come across are defined in the Level 3 Selectors specification, which is a mature specification, therefore you will find excellent browser support for these selectors.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="selector_lists">
            <header>Selector Lists</header>
            <p>If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a <em>selector list</em> so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. For example, if I have the same CSS for an <code>h1</code> and also a class of <code>.special</code>, I could write this as two separate rules.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    h1 { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      } <br>
                      <br>
                      .special { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    h1, .special { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the selectors more readable if each is on a new line.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    h1, <br>
                    .special { <br>
                    color: blue; <br>
                    } 
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>In the live example below try combining the two selectors which have identical declarations. The visual display should be the same after combining them.</p>
            <p>When you group selectors in this way, if any selector is invalid the whole rule will be ignored. In the following example, the invalid class selector rule will be ignored, whereas the h1 would still be styled.</p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <code>
                    h1 { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      } <br>
                      <br>
                      ..special { <br>
                        color: blue; <br>
                      } 
                </code>

            <p>There are a few different groupings of selectors, and knowing which type of selector you might need will help you to find the right tool for the job. In this article's subarticles we will look at the different groups of selectors in more detail.</p>
